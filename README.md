# Frontendize

Hey thanks for taking on our frontend challenge. Please work for 1-2 hours, but don't stress too hard. We don’t expect you to finish this challenge (unless you really want to); it’s more to get a sense of your approach to frontend design.

## Objective

Customize a child theme of the `BlankSlate` WordPress theme to your tastes. Deliver the child theme as a zip file we can install and try ourselves.

## Instructions

* Set up a copy of WordPress somewhere where we can preview it
* Install the [BlankSlate](https://wordpress.org/themes/blankslate/) theme
* Create a child theme
* Style it to your tastes
* Make sure it is mobile responsive. You can use Bootstrap, Foudnation, something else, or roll your own
* Send a zip file to me (ben@bytion.co) when you're done or when it's been 2 hours

## Bonus points

* Customize comment boxes and threads
* Customize widgets and sidebars
* Customize archive and category pages
* Install the `BuddyPress` plugin and customize the BuddyPress-specific CSS
* If you know how to use github, clone this repo as your child theme and send a PR
